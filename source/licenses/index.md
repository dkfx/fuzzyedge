## Responsible Disclosure
fuzzyEDGE is committed to disclosing vulnerabilities to vendors prior to publishing them in public. Only when a specific vendor has exceeded the customary 90 day window from disclosure or the vendor has fixed the issue will we publicly disclose a vulnerability. In addition, unless otherwise noted in a specific post, all posts are made without the sponsorship of a specific vendor. Any vendor sponsorship will be explicitly called out within a disclosure statement on the post itself. 

As always, if you have any concerns please [email us](mailto:matt@fuzzyedge.io) to ensure they are addressed promptly.
